üß† Technical Implementation Notes
Use wp_footer to inject popup container and dynamic logic.

For HTML popups, sanitize carefully and store as post meta.

Allow adding data-popup-click to HTML elements to count clicks (e.g., on CTA buttons).

Store view and click counts via AJAX to avoid reload dependency.

Dismissal logic handled via JavaScript and cookies.
